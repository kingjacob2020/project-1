# React Login / Signup UI

A simple authentication interface built with React as part of my frontend development practice.

This project focuses on building a clean UI, managing component state, and implementing conditional rendering using modern React patterns.

---

## 🚀 Current Features

- Toggle between **Sign up** and **Login** modes
- Conditional rendering using `useState`
- Dynamic UI updates based on selected action
- Styled form inputs with icon integration
- Button state styling for active/inactive modes

---

## 🧠 What I Practiced

- Managing UI state with `useState`
- Conditional rendering logic in React
- Structuring reusable components
- Debugging JSX nesting and syntax errors
- Handling relative asset paths in React projects
- Using Git for version control (add, commit, push)

---

## 📌 Next Steps

- Build a simple **Home page** layout
- Make the **Sign up / Login buttons work** (switch forms correctly)
- Add basic input handling with `useState`
- Add simple form validation (required fields, email format)
- Route between pages using React Router (Login → Home)

## ✅ Current Goal

Get navigation working so a user can:
1. Sign up / log in
2. Land on the Home page
3. Log out back to the Login page
